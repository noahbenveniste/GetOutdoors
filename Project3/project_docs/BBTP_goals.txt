1. Test that Invalid File Types don't load succesfully.
	- can test all files in a single test.
2. Test Updating of a Trail's Snow Depth from updating a Park's snowfall.
	- include a negative snowfall (melt) larger than snow depth and ensure 
		the depth is set to 0.

4. Test snow boundary of "needSnow = true " activities on, below, and above 
		the boundary. 
	- Can be tested in 3 ways: 
		 1. Changing an Activity's snowBoundary.
		 2. Changing a Park's latest snowfall.
		 3. Directly changing a Trail's snow depth.
		 4. Toggling snowBoundary to the opposite value.

5. Test snow boundary of "needSnow = false" activities on, below, and above 
		the boundary. Test this by changing 
	- Can be tested in 3 ways: 
		 1. Changing an Activity's snowBoundary.
		 2. Changing a Park's latest snowfall.
		 3. Directly changing a Trail's snow depth.
		 4. Toggling snowBoundary to the opposite value.

5. Test loading and saving valid files.

6. Test adding and removing trails.

7. Activity
	- Change description and save.
	- Adding new Activities.
	- Cancelling.

8. Park 
	- Adding a new Park(s).
	- Changing a Park's description.
	- Updating snowchange.
	- Cancelling.

9. Single Trail Adding
	- Adding a new Trail. 
	- Check that invalid values (empty text box or all whitespace) don't add
		new trails to a Park (TrailList underneath). 
	- Cancelling.

10. Adding/Removing Trails 
	- Adding/removing at front, middle, and back (according to naming order)

11. Filtering Trails, w/ different activities, closed for maintenance status,
